# Type Classes in Scala and Haskell

This repo contains two project folders each demonstrating type classes.
The "Scala" folder contains the source code of a little Scala project.
The "Haskell" folder contains the Haskell implementation.
The "Slides" folder obviously contains the slides of my talk on type classes.
